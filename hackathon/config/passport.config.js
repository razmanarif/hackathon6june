/**
 * ----------------
 * WHAT DOES DE SERIALIZE USER MEAN?
 * 1. Passport JS conveniently populates the "userObj" value in the deserializeUser() with the object attached at the end of "req.session.passport.user.{..}"
 * 2. When the done (null, user) function is called in the deserializeUser(), Passport JS takes this last object attached to "req.session.passport.user.{..}", and attaches it to "req.user" i.e "req.user.{..}"
 * In our case, since after calling the done() in "serializeUser" we had req.session.passport.user.{id: 123, name: "Kyle"},
 * calling the done() in the "deserializeUser" will take that last object that was attached to req.session.passport.user.{..} and attach to req.user.{..}
 * i.e. req.user.{id: 123, name: "Kyle"}
 * 3. So "req.user" will contain the authenticated user object for that session, and you can use it in any of the routes in the Node JS app.
 * eg.
 * app.get("/dashboard", (req, res) => {
 * res.render("dashboard.ejs", {name: req.user.name})
 * })

/*
 * This is Passport's strategy to provide local authentication. We provide the
 * following information to the LocalStrategy:
 *
 * Configuration: An object of data to identify our authentication fields, the
 * username and password
 *
 * Callback function: A function that's called to log the user in. We can pass
 * the email and password to a database query, and return the appropriate
 * information in the callback. Think of "cb" as a function that'll later look
 * like this:
 *
 * login(error, user) {
 *   // do stuff
 * }
 *
 * We need to provide the error as the first argument, and the user as the
 * second argument. We can provide "null" if there's no error, or "false" if
 * there's no user.
